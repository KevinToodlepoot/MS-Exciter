# M/S Exciter - Elevate your audio

I am excited to introduce my audio plug-in, the M/S Exciter, which started as my senior capstone project in undergraduate and now it's evolved to become a powerful tool for all audio enthusiasts. This plug-in is designed to elevate your audio to new heights, with its cutting-edge Mid Side processing and 4x oversampling technology, you can enhance stereo width and add high-quality harmonic richness to your tracks. Developed using the JUCE framework, the M/S Exciter offers a user-friendly interface and a powerful set of features.
